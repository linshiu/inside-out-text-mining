62,Joyce,And... we're out. That's what I'm talking about: another perfect day! Nice job everybody! Let's get those memories down to Long Term.,HEADQUARTERS,Joyce watches the screen go DARK. She inspects the shelves mostly populated with GOLDEN MEMORIES.
63,Felipe,"All right, we did not die today! I call that an unqualified success.",HEADQUARTERS,Joyce pulls a lever. Memories cascade down the shelves.
64,Joyce,"And that's it! We love our girl. She's got great friends and a great house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley's 11 now. What could happen?",HEADQUARTERS,The memories pachinko down the shelves and up a tube.

Joyce reaches for the ledge but they fall with a thud. Bing Bong stands. There's no way they'll make it.  He looks up at the ledge and then to his hand -- it's disappearing!
977,BING BONG,"Louder! Louder, Joyce! Sing louder!",MEMORY DUMP,"Hurdling down the largest hill yet, they continue to sing Bing Bong's song."
978,Joyce,We're gonna make it!,MEMORY DUMP,"Bing Bong times it just right... and jumps out of the wagon. Without his weight, the Joyce gains momentum. She's unaware of Bing Bong's absence."
979,Joyce,"Woohoo! Bing Bong, we did it! We--",MEMORY DUMP,The rocket makes it over the ledge! It crashes atop the cliff.
980,Joyce,Bing Bong? Bing Bong!,MEMORY DUMP,She turns around. She's alone.
