1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,420
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,682
"What is going on inside their head?"

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,449
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,000
And there she was...

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,531
Hello.

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,580
Riley.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,526
Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

8
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,603
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

9
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,643
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

10
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,487
For 33 seconds.

11
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,410
I'm Sadness.

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,180
Hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,727
Can I just... If you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,169
And that was just the beginning.

15
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,124
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,060
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

17
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,020
Sharp turn! No! Look out! No!

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,340
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,922
Easy, easy. We're good. We're good.

20
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,580
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

21
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,806
And we're back!

22
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,060
Here we go. All right, open.

23
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,700
- This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,801
What is it?

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,060
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,140
Hold on. What is that?

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,220
This is Disgust.

28
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,860
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,246
Physically and socially

30
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,380
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,460
Hold on, guys.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,780
It's broccoli!

33
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,041
Yucky!

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,540
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,500
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,887
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,100
That's Anger.

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,260
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,100
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,683
Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,006
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,100
Airplane. We got an airplane, everybody.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,486
Airplane.

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,728
And you've met Sadness.
She... Well, she...

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
I'm not actually sure what she does.

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,580
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,763
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

48
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,780
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,042
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,688
But the really important ones
are over here.

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,980
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called Core Memories.

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,180
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,620
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,300
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,606
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,820
And each Core Memory

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,780
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

58
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,167
Like Hockey Island.

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,122
Goofball Island is my personal favorite.

60
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,242
Come back here, you little monkey!

61
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,820
You're silly.

62
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,180
Yep, Goofball is the best.

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,123
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,443
I love Honesty Island.
And that's the truth!

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,082
And of course, Family Island is amazing.

66
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,700
The point is, the Islands of Personality
are what make Riley... Riley!

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,290
Look out, mermaid!

68
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,650
Lava!

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,007
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong!

70
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,450
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,647
Brain freeze!

72
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,521
Yeah!

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,651
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,324
And... we're out!

75
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,140
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

76
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,380
Nice job, everybody!

77
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,005
Let's get those memories
down to Long Term.

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,240
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

79
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,420
And that's it. We love our girl.

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,700
She's got great friends
and a great house.

81
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,620
Things couldn't be better.

82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,520
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

83
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
What...

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,168
Okay, not what I had in mind.

85
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,889
Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge!
Isn't that great?

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,300
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,845
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

88
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,380
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

89
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,211
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

90
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,681
Yeah...

91
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,260
- Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
- For Pete's sake! Move it!

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,460
These are my kind of people.

93
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,300
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,481
Step on it, Daddy!

95
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,140
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,740
We've already been in it forever.

97
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,540
Which, actually, was really lucky,

98
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,220
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

99
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,540
what our new house
is going to look like!

100
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,020
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

101
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,820
- That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

102
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,380
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

103
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,700
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

104
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,121
That's the one! It comes with a dragon.

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,250
Now we're getting close, I can feel it.

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,002
Here it is, here's our new house. And...

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,522
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

108
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,020
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

109
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

110
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,140
Can you die from moving?

111
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,540
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

112
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,641
A dead mouse!

113
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,460
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

114
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,500
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,761
Get off of me!

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,460
Hey. All through the drive,

117
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,540
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,580
Let's go check it out!

119
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,700
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

120
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,820
Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,060
No, no, no, no, no.

122
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,580
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

124
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,940
Riley can't live here.

125
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,100
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,460
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

127
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,180
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

128
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,860
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

129
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,180
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,220
Where did you read that?

131
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,660
It doesn't matter.
I read it and it's great.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,060
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

133
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,540
- The hockey lamp goes there.
- Put the chair there.

134
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,900
- The trophy collection goes there.
- Stars! I like that!

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,571
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving van!

136
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,340
All right. Goodbye.

137
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,300
Well, guess what? The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

138
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,780
You're kidding.

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,340
The van is lost?
It is the worst day ever!

140
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,140
That figures. The van is lost.

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,660
You said it would be here yesterday!

142
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,300
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,580
Mom and Dad are stressed out!

144
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,409
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,729
I've got a great idea!

146
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,260
Did you even read the contract?

147
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,820
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,020
Hey!

149
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,140
No, you're not!

150
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,220
She's lining up for the shot!

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,380
Coming behind you.

152
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,847
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

153
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,060
Come on, Grandma!

154
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,140
"Grandma"?

155
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,049
She put her hair up, we're in for it!

156
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,609
Hey, put me down!

157
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,211
Sorry. Hold on. Hold on.

158
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,460
Hello?

159
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,580
Wait. Wh...

160
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,806
You're kidding.

161
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,407
All right. Stall for me.
I'll be right there.

162
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,900
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,620
- I got to go.
- It's okay. We get it.

164
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,100
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

165
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,929
See you, sweetie.

166
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,325
Dad just left us.

167
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,220
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

168
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,403
Joy? What are you doing?

169
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,204
Just give me one second.

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,726
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

171
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,580
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,700
Maybe we could try that?

173
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,180
Pizza sounds delicious.

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,930
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

175
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,620
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,300
That's it. I'm done.

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,380
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,847
First the Hawaiians and now you!

179
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,060
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

180
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,340
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

181
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,740
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,820
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,020
That was disgusting.

184
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,540
Good. Family is running.

185
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,820
Dad's got a steel stomach.

186
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,940
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,700
Spitting out the car window!

188
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,211
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

189
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,260
Wearing a seat belt!

190
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,540
What about the time with the dinosaur?

191
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,766
- That's the one.
- Definitely!

192
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,380
Say cheese!

193
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,970
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

194
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,580
- Now hold still.
- The car!

195
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,889
Stop! No, no, no!

196
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,060
Nice one, Joy.

197
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,845
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

198
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,244
Wait. What? What happened?

199
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,449
She did something to the memory.

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,407
What did you do?

201
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,660
I just touched it.

202
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,580
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

203
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,020
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

204
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,060
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

205
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,540
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

206
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,202
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

207
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,522
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

208
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,420
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

209
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,660
- Okay.
- All right. Get ready.

210
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,446
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

211
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,049
Wait, what? What happened?

212
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,724
- A Core Memory!
- No!

213
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,020
Sadness, what are you doing?

214
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,522
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

215
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,900
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,445
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa.

217
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,540
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,020
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

219
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,140
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

220
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,060
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

221
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,300
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

222
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,020
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

223
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,300
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

224
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,260
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

225
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,940
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

226
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,180
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

227
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,329
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,540
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

229
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,580
Yeah, that's not...

230
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,300
What about that time with Meg

231
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,564
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

232
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,962
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

233
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,220
It was awful.

234
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,020
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

235
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,246
What are your favorite things to do?

236
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,500
My favorite?

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,568
Well, I like it when we're outside.

238
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,420
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

239
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,540
Like that time we buried Dad
in the sand up to his neck.

240
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
I was thinking more like rain.

241
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,460
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

242
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,380
We can stomp around in puddles.

243
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,740
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

244
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,620
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

245
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,700
And we get all cold, shivery,

246
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,700
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

247
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,900
Hey, hey. Hey, easy.

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,650
Why are you crying?

249
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,243
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

250
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,010
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

251
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,740
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

252
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,740
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

253
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,260
I've read most of them.

254
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,060
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

255
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,243
"Long Term Memory Retrieval, Volume 47"?

256
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,620
- No.
- A real page-turner!

257
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,540
"Long Term Memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

258
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,260
See? Fun already! You lucky dog.

259
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,967
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

260
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,647
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

261
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,340
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

262
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,700
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night!

263
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,060
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

264
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,367
We've got to land this, okay?

265
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,721
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

266
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,940
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

267
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,540
There are no bears in San Francisco.

268
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,740
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

269
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

270
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,460
I don't want to hear about your nerves.

271
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,500
I'll tell you what it is.

272
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,460
This move has been a bust.

273
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,700
That's what I've been telling you guys!

274
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,420
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

275
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,260
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

276
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,260
I can't believe
Mom and Dad moved us here!

277
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,540
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

278
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,980
But we've been through worse!

279
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,860
Tell you what, let's make a list
of all the things

280
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,660
Riley should be happy about.

281
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,580
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

282
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,700
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

283
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,460
And all of our stuff
is in the missing van!

284
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,260
Come on. It could be worse.

285
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,250
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

286
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,340
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

287
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,140
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,420
Let us handle this.

289
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,900
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,740
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

291
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,500
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

292
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,140
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

293
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,100
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

294
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,140
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

295
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,260
Hi, honey.

296
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,380
The Mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot-toot!

297
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,380
Still no moving van.

298
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,980
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

299
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,100
Toot-toot-toot!

300
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,180
Where's Dad?

301
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,420
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

302
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,980
I rest my case!

303
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,740
Your dad's a little stressed,

304
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,700
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

305
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,451
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

306
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,367
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

307
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,340
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

308
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,169
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

309
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,020
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

310
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,540
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

311
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,325
We can do that for him. Right?

312
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,207
Well.

313
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,166
Yeah, sure.

314
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,410
What did we do to deserve you?

315
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,170
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

316
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,860
Well, you can't argue with Mom.
Happy it is.

317
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,260
Team Happy! Sounds great!

318
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,441
Totally behind you, Joy.

319
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,740
Looks like we're going into REM.

320
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,700
I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to Long Term.

321
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,691
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, Team Happy!

322
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,367
All right, what's on tonight,
Dream Production?

323
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,124
Well, this is it. The new place.

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,727
Come live with me, Riley.

325
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,460
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

326
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,130
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

327
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,940
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

328
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,042
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

329
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,368
We are not going to
end the day like this.

330
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,660
Don't you worry.

331
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

332
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,649
I promise.

333
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,740
Hello! Did I wake you?

334
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,860
Do you have to play that?

335
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,180
Well, I have to practice.

336
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,886
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

337
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,540
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

338
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,900
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,020
Here it is! Fear.

340
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,660
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

341
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,900
on the first day at a new school.

342
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,300
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

343
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,700
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

344
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,620
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

345
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,802
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

346
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,940
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

347
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,900
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,650
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

349
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,081
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

350
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,448
Train of Thought! Right on schedule.

351
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,380
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

352
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,580
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

353
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,660
It might come in handy.

354
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,980
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

355
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,620
Which it probably will be.

356
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,380
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

357
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,608
- Really?
- Follow me.

358
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,100
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

359
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,260
This is the circle of Sadness.

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,660
Your job is to make sure that
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

361
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,580
So you want me to just stand here?

362
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,940
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

363
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,420
Just make sure that
all the Sadness stays in the circle!

364
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,780
See? You're a pro at this!
Isn't this fun?

365
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,020
- No.
- Atta girl.

366
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,260
All right, everyone, fresh start.

367
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,442
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

368
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,660
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

369
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,100
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

370
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,700
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

371
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,100
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

372
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,780
Very cute!

373
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,460
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

374
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,420
Mom and Dad? With us in public?

375
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,860
- No thank you.
- I'm on it!

376
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,460
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

377
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,800
Have a good day at school, monkey.

378
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,380
Have a great day, sweetheart!

379
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,165
- That's crazy. It really is.
- That was so funny.

380
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,085
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

381
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,060
Are you sure we want to do this?

382
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,925
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

383
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,740
Did you see her? Hello!

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,820
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

385
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,180
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

386
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,900
Is she wearing eye shadow?

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,940
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

388
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,580
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

389
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,980
We want them to like us.

390
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,380
Yeah. Wait, what?

391
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,380
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

392
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,927
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

393
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,340
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

394
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,860
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

395
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,180
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

396
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,100
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

397
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,420
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

398
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,646
Don't worry. I got this.

399
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,740
Okay.

400
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,340
My name is Riley Andersen.

401
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,649
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

402
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,248
And how about Minnesota?

403
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,700
Can you tell us something about it?

404
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,882
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

405
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,970
She's hilarious!

406
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,140
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

407
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,620
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

408
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,940
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

409
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,980
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

410
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,540
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

411
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,460
It's kind of a family tradition.

412
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,289
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

413
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,980
Or we did, till I moved away.

414
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,100
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

415
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,410
Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

416
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,140
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

417
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,780
Get back in your circle.

418
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,360
- What's going on? Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

419
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,580
We used to play tag and stuff.

420
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,727
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

421
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,740
- Did you see that look?
- No.

422
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,841
They're judging us!

423
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,420
Somebody help me!
Grab that... Everybody put...

424
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,525
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

425
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,090
No! We're crying! At school!

426
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,606
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

427
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,448
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

428
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,660
It's a Core Memory!

429
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,444
But it's blue.

430
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,766
No! Wait! Stop it! No! No!

431
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,820
Joy, no.

432
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,340
- That's a Core Memory!
- Hey!

433
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,220
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

434
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,049
The Core Memories!

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,291
No, no, no, no!

436
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,740
Thank you, Riley.

437
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,340
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

438
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,820
but we're happy to have you here.

439
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,980
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

440
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,208
and turn to chapter seven.

441
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,288
Can I say that curse word now?

442
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,408
No! One, two, three. Okay.

443
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,410
I got them. Where are we?

444
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,371
Long Term Memory? Wait...

445
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,289
Goofball Island?

446
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,245
Riley's Islands of Personality.
They're all down!

447
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,940
This is bad.

448
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,460
We... We can fix this!

449
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,380
We just have to get back
to Headquarters,

450
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,121
plug the Core Memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

451
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,529
Riley has no Core Memories.
No Personality Islands and no...

452
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,580
What? What is it?

453
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,660
You.

454
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,820
You're not in Headquarters.

455
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,287
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

456
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,810
We got to get you back up there.

457
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,845
I'm coming, Riley.

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,260
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for greens.

459
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,900
Like compost. And eggshells.

460
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,740
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

461
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,780
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

462
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,220
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down.

463
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,420
Joy would know what to do.

464
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,580
That's it.

465
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,445
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

466
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,900
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

467
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

468
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,300
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

469
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,340
And get this: try-outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

470
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,860
- Hockey?
- What do we do?

471
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,420
Guys, this is...

472
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,780
You pretend to be Joy.

473
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,723
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

474
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,002
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

475
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,820
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

476
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,161
- Because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

477
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,540
Did you guys pick up on that?

478
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,563
- Something's wrong.
- Totally.

479
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,820
Should we ask her?

480
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,700
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

481
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,020
So, how was the first day of school?

482
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,260
She's probing us.

483
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,820
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

484
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,604
What? Okay.

485
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,580
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

486
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,380
Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

487
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,580
Something is definitely going on.

488
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,001
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

489
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,700
We're going to find out
what's happening.

490
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,060
But we'll need support.

491
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,161
Signal the husband.

492
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,889
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across... and nice!

493
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,127
She's looking at us.

494
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,220
- What did she say?
- What?

495
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,780
Sorry, sir. No one was listening.

496
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,180
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

497
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,100
What? What is it, woman? What?

498
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,362
He's making that stupid face again.

499
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,260
I could strangle him right now.

500
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,521
Signal him again.

501
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,900
So, Riley, how was school?

502
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,860
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

503
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,930
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

504
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,140
Move! I'll be Joy.

505
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,060
School was great, all right?

506
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,242
Riley. Is everything okay?

507
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,260
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

508
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,980
What is her deal?

509
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,730
All right, make a show of force.

510
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,260
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

511
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,260
No, not the foot!

512
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,601
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

513
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,220
I'll show you attitude, old man.

514
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,685
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

515
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,740
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

516
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,580
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

517
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,460
Take it to DEFCON Two.

518
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,528
You heard that, gentlemen. DEFCON Two.

519
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

520
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,420
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

521
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,980
Yeah, well... Well...

522
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,367
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

523
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,370
Keys to safety position.

524
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,730
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

525
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,045
Just shut up!

526
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,620
Fire!

527
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,520
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

528
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,730
The foot is down! The foot is down!

529
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,726
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

530
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,770
Well, that was a disaster.

531
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,691
Come fly with me, gatinha.

532
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,811
We're going to walk out there? On that?

533
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,620
It's the quickest way back.

534
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,780
But it's right over the Memory Dump.

535
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,140
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

536
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,220
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

537
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,723
- Okay.
- It's not that high. It's totally fine...

538
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
Hey.

539
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,930
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

540
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,849
Do you want to talk about it?

541
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,167
Come on, where's my happy girl?

542
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,721
Monkey.

543
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,689
He's trying to start up Goofball.

544
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,326
Come on!

545
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,290
Go back! Run, run, run!

546
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,491
What...

547
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,605
I get it. You need some alone time.

548
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,846
We'll talk later.

549
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,169
We have a major problem.

550
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,211
Joy, where are you?

551
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,940
We lost Goofball Island.

552
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,780
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

553
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,380
You can fix this, right, Joy?

554
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,481
I...

555
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,060
I don't know.

556
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,208
But we have to try. Okay, come on.

557
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,620
Riley's gone to sleep.

558
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,700
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

559
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,940
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

560
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,100
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

561
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,726
We'll just go across Friendship Island.

562
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,500
We'll never make it.

563
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,820
- No!
- No, no, no!

564
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,300
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

565
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,180
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

566
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,806
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

567
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,380
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

568
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,820
Wait, Joy, you could get lost in there!

569
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,460
Think positive!

570
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,087
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

571
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,380
That's Long Term Memory.

572
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,980
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

573
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,580
I read about it in the manuals.

574
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,620
The manuals? The manuals!

575
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,500
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

576
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
So you know the way
back to Headquarters!

577
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,847
I guess.

578
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,967
You are my map!

579
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,660
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

580
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,500
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

581
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,604
Just give me a few... hours.

582
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,260
Which way? Left?

583
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,441
Right.

584
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,460
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

585
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,700
Okay.

586
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,900
This actually feels kind of nice.

587
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,340
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to Headquarters before morning.

588
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,047
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

589
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,291
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

590
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,890
Yeah, just another right.

591
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,420
And... a left and then another...
left and...

592
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,860
Are you sure you know where we're going?

593
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,770
Because we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

594
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,449
Riley's awake.

595
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,580
Don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

596
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,180
Sorry, I won't. Starting now.

597
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,567
I can't take much more of this.

598
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,140
Forget them!

599
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,720
- Mind workers!
- But, Joy, we're almost...

600
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,740
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

601
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,842
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

602
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,940
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this.

603
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,500
Four years of piano lessons.

604
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,780
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

605
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,804
You know what? Save Chopsticks
and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

606
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,940
- Are you...
- U.S. Presidents. What do you think?

607
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,260
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

608
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,500
- Forget them!
- Hey! You can't throw those away!

609
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,931
Those are perfectly good memories.

610
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,260
The names of
every "Cutie Pie Princess" doll?

611
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,420
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, Honeypants...

612
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Forget them!

613
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,740
Hey! Bring those back!

614
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,980
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

615
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,660
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

616
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,100
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

617
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,580
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

618
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

619
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,620
- TripleDent gum
- Will make you smile

620
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,940
The song from the gum commercial?

621
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,460
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

622
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,940
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

623
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,780
Like a million times!

624
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,900
Let's watch it again!

625
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,540
TripleDent gum

626
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,580
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

627
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,780
Hey, what do you think? Should we do it?

628
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,881
Yeah!

629
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,490
Okay, here we go!

630
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,681
TripleDent gum

631
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,450
What the... This again?

632
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,121
Wait! Do you know
how to get to Friendship Island?

633
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,460
TripleDent gum

634
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,740
Do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

635
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,540
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

636
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,660
We won the first game.

637
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,940
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

638
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,900
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

639
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,500
She did not just say that.

640
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,410
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

641
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,980
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

642
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,208
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

643
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,500
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

644
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,011
It's like mind reading!

645
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,340
You like to read minds, Meg?

646
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,300
I got something for you to read,
right here!

647
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,731
Let's just be calm for one second!

648
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,180
- I heard they have parrots...
- I've got to go.

649
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,611
- What?
- I got to go!

650
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,250
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... Oh, no!

651
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,802
Friendship Island! What?

652
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,445
Not Friendship.

653
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,820
Riley loved that one. And now it's gone.

654
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,527
Goodbye, friendship. Hello, loneliness.

655
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,923
We'll just have to go the long way.

656
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,129
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

657
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,411
I'm ready.

658
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,967
There's got to be a better way.

659
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,601
Look at you!

660
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,500
I will take you, but not you.

661
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,648
Who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

662
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,780
Hello!

663
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,120
Wait! Hey! Wait!

664
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,124
Wait! Stop!

665
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,887
Excuse me.

666
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,420
I was looking for... Diversion!

667
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,363
- What?
- So long, sucker!

668
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,100
I hurt all over.

669
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,940
Wait. I know you.

670
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,620
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

671
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,060
No, no, no. I do.

672
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,860
Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

673
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,420
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

674
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,980
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

675
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,580
You would know. We're trying
to get back to Headquarters.

676
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,780
Headquarters?
You guys are from Headquarters?

677
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,940
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

678
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,740
You're Joy? The Joy?

679
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,420
What the heck are you doing out here?

680
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,580
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

681
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,620
Without you, Riley won't ever be happy.

682
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,100
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

683
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,140
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

684
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,260
Thank you!

685
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,980
It is so great to see you again.

686
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,260
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

687
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,300
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

688
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,260
I went to all of your concerts.

689
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,780
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

690
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,405
Watching you play tag was such a treat.

691
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,780
Two-time world champ.

692
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,500
And remember your rockets?

693
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,820
Of course! It runs on song power!

694
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,340
That's right! Your theme song!

695
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,780
Who's your friend who likes to play?

696
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,100
Bing Bong
Bing Bong

697
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,500
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

698
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,340
- Bing Bong, Bing Bong
- Bing Bong, Bing Bong

699
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,740
What exactly are you supposed to be?

700
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,500
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

701
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,340
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

702
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,282
Dolphin?

703
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,340
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

704
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,300
The cow goes moo. The horse goes neigh.

705
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,020
That's all people
talked about back then.

706
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

707
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,060
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

708
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,640
So I, you know...

709
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,700
Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

710
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,860
Tell you what.
When I get back up to Headquarters,

711
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,860
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

712
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,327
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

713
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,926
This is the greatest day of my life!

714
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,801
Are you okay?

715
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,300
- Hey, what's going on?
- I cry candy.

716
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,482
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

717
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,140
- Here, use this.
- Thanks!

718
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,287
Hold on, wait a second.

719
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,842
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

720
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,580
Here. What? It's imaginary.

721
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,620
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to Headquarters.

722
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,460
Walk? We're not walking.

723
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,688
We're taking the Train of Thought!

724
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,060
The train, of course!

725
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,700
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

726
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,460
Well, it kind of goes
all over the place,

727
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,686
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

728
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,700
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

729
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,007
I am so glad we ran into you!

730
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,260
The station is right through here.
After you.

731
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,660
- Joy.
- What?

732
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,900
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,420
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

734
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,740
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

735
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,340
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

736
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,206
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

737
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,202
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

738
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,460
Let's go around. This way.

739
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,289
Almost there!

740
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,660
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

741
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,740
But Riley needs to be happy.

742
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm not missing that train.
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

743
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,500
He's part dolphin. They're very smart.

744
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,284
Well, I guess.

745
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,249
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

746
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,488
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

747
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,820
Loneliness.

748
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,460
Looks like there's something in there.

749
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

750
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,611
What did I tell you?
You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

751
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,290
Say, would you look at that?

752
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,968
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, they turned it on.

753
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,921
Never seen this before.

754
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,684
My face! My beautiful face!

755
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,860
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

756
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,020
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective Fragmentation!

757
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,180
All right. Do not panic.

758
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,681
What is important
is that we all stay together.

759
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,700
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

760
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,801
Run!

761
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,091
I can't feel my legs!

762
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,860
There they are.

763
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,200
Come here, me!

764
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,860
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

765
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,500
We'll get stuck here forever!

766
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,340
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

767
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,011
I told you, it's a shortcut!

768
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,645
The train!

769
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,100
Oh, no. We're two-dimensional!
That's stage three!

770
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,180
We're getting nowhere!

771
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,329
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

772
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,740
We can't fit.

773
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,620
Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

774
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,529
We're not going to make it!

775
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,961
Wait! We're two-dimensional.
Fall on your face!

776
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,689
Stop! Stop!

777
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,100
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

778
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,100
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

779
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,089
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

780
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,447
How long until the next train?

781
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,260
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

782
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,420
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to Headquarters.

783
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,488
If we hurry, we can catch it.

784
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,887
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

785
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,300
Yeah!

786
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,180
Is there really another station?

787
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,486
Through there.

788
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,160
Welcome to Imagination Land!

789
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,460
- Imagination Land?
- Sure!

790
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,900
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

791
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,740
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fry Forest!

792
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,100
- Delicious.
- No way!

793
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,780
Check it out! Trophy Town!

794
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,963
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

795
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,620
I won first place!

796
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,460
- Me too!
- Participation award.

797
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,980
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's Cloud Town!

798
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,060
That is my favorite!

799
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,491
It's so soft!

800
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,300
Let me try.

801
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,140
Hey! What's the big idea?

802
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,005
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

803
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,525
Oh, no! Lava!

804
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,923
Imagination Land is the best!

805
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,820
Is it all going to be so interactive?

806
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,220
Hey, look! The House of Cards!

807
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,660
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

808
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,180
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

809
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,020
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

810
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,521
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

811
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,500
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

812
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,660
I love Imagination Land.

813
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,525
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

814
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,340
Who the heck is that?

815
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,740
Imaginary boyfriend.

816
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,683
I would die for Riley.

817
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,642
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

818
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,860
Anyway, this way.
Through Preschool World!

819
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,122
- We're nearly to the train!
- Riley, here we come!

820
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,860
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

821
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,220
These kids look pretty good,

822
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,940
considering they're from San Francisco.

823
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,340
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

824
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,420
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

825
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,700
Luck isn't going to help us now.

826
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,540
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

827
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,940
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

828
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,820
One of these has got to work
in place of the Core Memory.

829
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,331
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

830
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,646
We did it, gang! It's working!

831
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,890
Line change! Line change! Change it up!

832
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,086
No! No!

833
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,260
It's like we don't learn anything.

834
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,380
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

835
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,926
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

836
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,900
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

837
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,206
Find your happy place.

838
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,010
What's her problem?

839
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,260
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

840
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,900
- You're not going to finish try-outs?
- What's the point?

841
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,287
Hey. It'll be all right.
Let's just go back...

842
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,402
Stop saying everything
will be all right!

843
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,891
Nice hustle, ladies!

844
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,321
Hockey?

845
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,940
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

846
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,260
- Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
- Hey!

847
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,180
Bing Bong,
we have to get to that station.

848
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,420
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham Cracker Castle.

849
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,660
Hey. That's weird. Graham Cracker
Castle used to be right here.

850
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,060
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

851
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,660
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here.

852
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,500
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

853
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,125
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess Dream World!

854
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,969
Oh, no! The stuffed Animal Hall of Fame!

855
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,601
My rocket!

856
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,500
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

857
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,060
It still has some song power left!

858
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,685
Who's your friend who likes to play?

859
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,860
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

860
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,291
Riley and I are going to the moon!

861
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,328
Riley can't be done with me.

862
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,060
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

863
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,060
We just need to
get back to Headquarters.

864
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,500
Which way to the train station?

865
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,080
I had a whole trip planned for us.

866
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,048
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

867
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,925
Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this!

868
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,060
Here's a fun game!

869
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,220
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

870
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,563
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

871
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,009
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

872
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,460
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

873
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,900
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

874
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,209
- Sorry.
- It's all I had left of Riley.

875
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,971
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

876
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,180
They were wonderful.

877
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,001
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

878
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,140
Sadness...

879
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,846
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

880
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,580
She did. We were best friends.

881
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,001
Yeah. It's sad.

882
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,770
I'm okay now.

883
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,044
Come on. The train station is this way.

884
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,130
How did you do that?

885
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,140
I don't know. He was sad.

886
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,460
So I listened to what...

887
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,927
Hey! There's the train!

888
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,921
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

889
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,660
Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions
look so similar.

890
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,286
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

891
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,286
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an F.

892
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,380
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

893
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,540
Like what, genius?

894
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,500
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

895
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,685
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

896
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,010
Emotions can't quit, genius!

897
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,928
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

898
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,090
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

899
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,530
- What is it?
- Nothing.

900
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,900
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

901
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,580
All the good Core Memories
were made in Minnesota.

902
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,740
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

903
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,860
- Ta-da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

904
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,860
You're saying we run away?

905
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,340
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

906
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,020
I'd call it the Happy Core
Memory Development program.

907
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,380
You can't be serious.

908
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,860
Hey! Our life was perfect

909
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,885
until Mom and Dad decided
to move to San Fran Stinktown.

910
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,220
I mean, it's just so drastic!

911
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,500
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

912
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,285
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

913
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,380
- TripleDent gum
- Will make you smile

914
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,721
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

915
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,605
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

916
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,220
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

917
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,368
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

918
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,340
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

919
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,330
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

920
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,807
are just around the corner.

921
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,380
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

922
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,780
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

923
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,700
You mean we're stuck here until morning?

924
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,980
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

925
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,420
- We can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up?

926
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,364
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

927
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,780
How about we wake her up?

928
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,406
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

929
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,500
This place is huge!

930
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,046
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

931
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,724
I Can Fly? I love that one!

932
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,488
Rainbow Unicorn! She's right there!

933
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,460
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

934
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,300
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay?

935
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,370
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

936
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,802
I loved you in
Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7.

937
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,490
Okay, bye. I love you!

938
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,460
Wonder what that means.

939
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,766
Well, let's go in.

940
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,700
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

941
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,660
We've got a lot to work with here.

942
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,660
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

943
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,780
and quit hockey.

944
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,020
The writers have
put together a killer script!

945
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,282
Just because Joy and Sadness are gone,

946
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,925
I have to do stupid Dream Duty.

947
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,660
Okay. How are we going to wake her up?

948
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,620
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

949
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,660
We could scare her.

950
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,001
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

951
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,140
- But, Joy...
- Sadness,

952
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,660
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

953
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,220
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

954
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,580
We'll excite her awake!

955
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,728
That's never happened before.

956
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,380
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

957
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,460
I don't think that'll work.

958
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,180
- Bing Bong?
- Yeah?

959
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,329
- Don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

960
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,802
Add the reality distortion filter.

961
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,700
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

962
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,420
Riley is the camera!

963
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,808
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

964
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,980
Hello, class.

965
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,540
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

966
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,340
Man, she is one bad actress.

967
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,204
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

968
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,380
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

969
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,540
Would you like to stand up

970
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,324
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

971
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,220
And cue Riley.

972
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,980
My name is Riley Andersen.

973
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,924
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

974
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,483
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

975
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,740
- That's disgusting.
- Gross!

976
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,446
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

977
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,284
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

978
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,380
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

979
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,540
Called it!

980
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,580
Ready?

981
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,900
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

982
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,525
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

983
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,922
Bark! Bark! Bark!

984
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,087
Who is that?

985
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,801
What's going on?

986
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,685
You're on! Go!

987
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,486
Let's party! Let's dance!

988
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,206
Hey, a party.

989
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,820
Bark, bark, bark!

990
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,888
Joy, this isn't working.

991
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,210
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

992
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,880
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

993
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,251
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

994
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,780
Hi, Riley, it's me!

995
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,300
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong?

996
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,051
- Bing Bong, Bing Bong!
- Sadness, stop! It was working!

997
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,500
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

998
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,045
But look, it's working!

999
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,770
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1000
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,566
Stop right there!

1001
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,766
Pan away! Pan away!

1002
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,260
Pick a plotline!

1003
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,020
- Careful!
- Hold still!

1004
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,460
You can't do this!

1005
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,642
I know people in Headquarters!

1006
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,740
Cut that out! Please!

1007
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,940
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1008
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,849
No, no. No, no!

1009
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,965
There go the Core Memories!

1010
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,401
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1011
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,766
Come on.

1012
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,860
- What is this place?
- The Subconscious.

1013
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,885
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1014
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,980
My hat feels loose.

1015
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,580
How do we get in?

1016
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,251
- Let me see.
- You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1017
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,691
- Yeah, it's my hat.
- You sure? Look in the label.

1018
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,500
- Yeah, it says, "My hat."
- Wait, it says, "My hat"?

1019
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,340
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1020
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,860
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1021
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,380
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1022
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,006
- Hey! You!
- You caught us!

1023
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,327
Get back in there! No escaping!

1024
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,404
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1025
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,004
It's broccoli.

1026
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,329
The stairs to the basement!

1027
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,649
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1028
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,400
Okay, come on.

1029
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,362
- Would you walk quieter?
- I'm trying.

1030
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,721
What is going...

1031
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,847
Candy wrappers?

1032
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,140
- Bing Bong!
- Joy?

1033
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,241
There you are.

1034
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,721
It's Jangles.

1035
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,929
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1036
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,620
Do you have the Core Memories?

1037
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,361
Yeah. All he cared about was the candy!

1038
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,660
We're out of here!
Let's get to that train!

1039
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,860
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1040
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,166
But how?

1041
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,286
Oh, no!

1042
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,740
Hey, Sadness. Did you hear
about the party they were having?

1043
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,420
Yeah. Yes, Joy.
Isn't it a birthday party?

1044
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,046
Did you say birthday?

1045
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,580
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1046
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,860
And games and balloons...

1047
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,371
A birthday?

1048
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,448
Okay. Follow us!

1049
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,100
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1050
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,620
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1051
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,131
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1052
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,480
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1053
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,080
Who's the birthday girl?

1054
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,890
Come on, let's go!

1055
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,900
We made it!

1056
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,420
Guess who's on their way
to Headquarters!

1057
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,521
We are!

1058
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,100
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1059
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,580
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1060
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,060
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw Bing Bong!

1061
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,380
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1062
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,180
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1063
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,940
Time to take action.

1064
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,620
Stupid Mom and Dad.

1065
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,860
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1066
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,200
Who's with me?

1067
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,521
No.

1068
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,209
Yeah. Let's do it.

1069
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,300
She took it. There's no turning back.

1070
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,020
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1071
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,140
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1072
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,300
and rent an elephant?

1073
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,580
Hey. That sounds nice.

1074
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,125
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1075
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,300
There's a bus leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1076
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,380
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1077
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,780
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1078
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,565
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1079
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,020
- TripleDent gum
- No!

1080
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,408
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.

1081
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,165
They can pay to get us out.

1082
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,260
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1083
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,500
Look, there's Inductive Reasoning.
There's Déja Vu.

1084
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,340
There's Language Processing.
There's Déja Vu.

1085
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,020
There's Critical Thinking.
There's Déja Vu.

1086
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,770
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1087
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,860
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1088
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,420
You're not so bad.

1089
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,760
Really?

1090
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,281
Nice work.

1091
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,900
I can't wait to get the old Riley back.

1092
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,780
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1093
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,100
Is this Riley?

1094
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,940
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1095
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,460
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1096
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,245
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1097
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,380
The hockey team showed up
and Mom and Dad were there cheering.

1098
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,165
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1099
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,485
I love this one.

1100
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,860
I love that one, too.

1101
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,420
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1102
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,260
Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1103
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,649
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1104
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,924
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1105
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,420
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1106
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,681
Okay.

1107
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,525
But I just don't understand.

1108
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,889
Why did our moving van even go to Texas?

1109
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,450
Multiple customers?

1110
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,846
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1111
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,481
Excuse me, isn't there any way
that you can rush it?

1112
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,203
Honesty Island?

1113
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,249
Look out!

1114
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,771
Come on!

1115
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,180
Hold on!

1116
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,410
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1117
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,561
Oh that was our way home.

1118
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,660
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1119
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,980
Haven't you heard? Riley's running away.

1120
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,241
What?

1121
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,649
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1122
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,820
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1123
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,500
Look. We have no Core Memories.

1124
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,100
You want Riley to be happy?

1125
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,771
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1126
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,090
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1127
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,964
Family Island. Let's go!

1128
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,210
Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous!

1129
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,450
We won't make it in time.

1130
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,130
But that's our only way back!

1131
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,245
A recall tube!

1132
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,007
We can get recalled!

1133
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,740
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1134
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,365
See you after school, monkey.

1135
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,001
We love you!

1136
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,361
Go! Run, run! Go!

1137
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,045
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1138
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,420
You're hurting Riley!

1139
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,363
No, no, no! I did it again!

1140
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,526
If you get in here,
these Core Memories will get sad.

1141
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,100
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1142
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,929
Joy?

1143
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,011
Joy!

1144
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,891
Joy!

1145
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,486
Joy?

1146
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,645
Joy!

1147
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,771
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1148
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,766
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1149
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,211
We're forgotten.

1150
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,131
We used to play tag and stuff.

1151
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,242
But everything's different now.

1152
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,204
Since we moved.

1153
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:11,803
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1154
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,522
I could listen to her stories all day.

1155
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,725
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1156
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,205
And now...

1157
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,900
It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1158
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,527
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1159
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,930
She wanted to quit.

1160
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,290
Sadness.

1161
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,802
Mom and Dad... The team...

1162
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,567
They came to help because of Sadness.

1163
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,444
We have to get back up there.

1164
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,448
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1165
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,322
We might as well be on another planet.

1166
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,089
Another planet.

1167
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,571
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1168
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,700
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1169
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,644
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1170
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,209
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1171
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,420
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1172
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,124
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1173
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,121
Hop in.

1174
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,780
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1175
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,940
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1176
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,884
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1177
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,940
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1178
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,940
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1179
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,611
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1180
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,820
Come on!

1181
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,140
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1182
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,460
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1183
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,460
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1184
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,085
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1185
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,130
Come on, Joy. One more time.

1186
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,570
I got a feeling about this one.

1187
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,980
Bing Bong, Bing Bong
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1188
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,411
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1189
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,140
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1190
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,580
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1191
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,460
Louder! Joy, sing louder!

1192
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,608
To sing this song to say
Who's your friend who likes to...

1193
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,050
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1194
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,049
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1195
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,500
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1196
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,660
Bing Bong

1197
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,125
We're gonna make it!

1198
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,820
Bing Bong! We did it!

1199
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,561
We... Bing Bong? Bing Bong!

1200
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,245
You made it!

1201
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,847
Go! Go save Riley!

1202
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,567
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1203
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,441
I'll try, Bing Bong.

1204
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,003
I promise.

1205
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,810
We're home!

1206
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,251
Riley? Riley!

1207
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,011
I'll call her cell.

1208
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,900
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1209
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,286
Yep, let's cross the street.

1210
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,460
It's Mom. She's onto us!

1211
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,846
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1212
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,380
Riley needs to get Core Memories.

1213
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,050
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1214
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,610
Sadness!

1215
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,140
Sadness! Sadness?

1216
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,660
Come on, Sadness. Where are you?

1217
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,331
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1218
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,580
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1219
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,002
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1220
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,086
Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do?

1221
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,408
This is madness! She shouldn't run away!

1222
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,010
Let's get this idea out of her head.

1223
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,081
Sadness?

1224
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,840
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1225
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,487
Wait! Sadness!

1226
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,180
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1227
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,281
Come back!

1228
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,180
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1229
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,340
Was he with anyone?

1230
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,780
Yes! And there she is!

1231
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,220
Hey! Come back here!

1232
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,482
Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town.

1233
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,810
What? Sadness!

1234
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,180
I only make everything worse!

1235
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,567
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1236
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,220
- It's stuck!
- Great.

1237
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,540
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1238
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,324
Oh, no! What is this?

1239
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,860
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1240
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,580
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1241
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,740
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1242
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,860
Nothing's working! Why isn't it working?

1243
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,300
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1244
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,641
- No, I didn't! Don't touch that!
- Move!

1245
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,002
Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything.

1246
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,609
What have we done?

1247
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,460
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1248
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,900
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1249
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,684
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1250
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,420
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1251
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,046
I would die for Riley!

1252
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,364
That's it! I fold!

1253
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,530
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1254
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,208
I am positive this is crazy!

1255
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,970
- Now!
- For Riley!

1256
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,488
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1257
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,842
I wish Joy was here!

1258
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,445
It's Joy!

1259
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,560
Stand back!

1260
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,540
That worked.

1261
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,290
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1262
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,900
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1263
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,900
What?

1264
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,740
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1265
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,660
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1266
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,049
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1267
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,940
Thank goodness you're back!

1268
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,940
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1269
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,929
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1270
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,420
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1271
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,220
Sadness, it's up to you.

1272
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,561
- Me?
- Sadness?

1273
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,780
I can't, Joy.

1274
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,486
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1275
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,561
Okay.

1276
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,885
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1277
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,100
All right. Thank you. We will.

1278
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,660
Her teacher
hasn't even seen Riley all day.

1279
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,888
- What was she wearing last?
- I can't believe this.

1280
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,820
Riley, there you are! Thank goodness!

1281
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,300
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1282
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,460
Honey! What happened? Are you all right?

1283
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,300
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1284
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,481
we talked to your teacher.

1285
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,483
I know you don't want me to but...

1286
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,211
I miss home.

1287
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,724
I miss Minnesota.

1288
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,323
You need me to be happy, but...

1289
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,523
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1290
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,409
I want to go home.

1291
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,329
Please don't be mad.

1292
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,008
- Sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1293
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,121
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1294
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,371
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1295
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,681
And the backyard where you used to play.

1296
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,370
Spring Lake, where you learned to skate.

1297
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,766
Come here.

1298
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,700
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1299
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,180
Friendship Island has expanded.

1300
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,860
Glad they finally opened
that Friendly Argument section.

1301
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,180
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1302
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,860
Fashion Island? Everyone shut up.

1303
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,180
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1304
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,980
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1305
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,580
All right. Here you go.

1306
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,331
Your new expanded console
is up and running.

1307
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,780
Cool! Upgrade!

1308
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,928
Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1309
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,740
Hey, guys? What's pub-er-ty?

1310
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,060
I don't know.
It's probably not important.

1311
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,820
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1312
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,082
This new console is the...

1313
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,610
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1314
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:42,721
They're getting to the rink.

1315
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,380
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1316
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,100
- I know, Dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1317
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,940
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1318
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,020
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go Foghorns!

1319
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:58,580
- Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
- Okay! I got to go!

1320
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,900
They love us.

1321
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,580
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

1322
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,206
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1323
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,965
She loved the face painting!

1324
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,081
Told you it was a great idea!

1325
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,569
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1326
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,566
Just in case.

1327
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,441
Oh! Sorry.

1328
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,765
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1329
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,290
Okay. Bye.

1330
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,407
Remember, just hustle.

1331
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,045
- Go, Riley!
- You got this!

1332
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,220
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1333
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,448
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1334
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:51,980
All right, Anger, take it!

1335
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,220
Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1336
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,300
On our left. On our left!

1337
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,140
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1338
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,300
Mom and Dad are watching us fail.

1339
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,845
Not for long!

1340
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,140
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1341
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,180
But we still love our girl.

1342
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,860
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1343
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,340
Things couldn't be better.

1344
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,764
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1345
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,580
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1346
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,648
Anyone? Jordan?

1347
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,640
How much more of this?

1348
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,340
Five months, two weeks and four days
until summer vacation.

1349
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,020
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1350
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,124
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1351
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,484
Have a nice day.

1352
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,700
What are we mad about?

1353
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,660
I don't know. Whatever Troy's mad about.

1354
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,491
- What's Troy mad about?
- I don't know.

1355
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,611
I know. Totally.

1356
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,060
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1357
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,969
Of course not! We're wearing eye shadow!

1358
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,287
Being cool is so exhausting.

1359
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,886
Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello!

1360
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,380
Six years of drama school for this?

1361
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,970
Move it, will you?

1362
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,444
What are you doing? Come on!

1363
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,180
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1364
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,540
We just need to go to our happy place.

1365
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,700
TripleDent gum

1366
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,404
No! Not this again!
